        <h3 style="text-align: center">The Incorrect Quote Generator</h3><a name="incorrect_quote_generator"></a>
        <p>The Incorrect Quote Generator is a program hosted on <a href="https://perchance.org">Perchance</a>, a website where anyone can program and
        host randomized generators for free, intended to take user-inputted names and place them into a dialogue-based joke similar to a game of
        mad-libs.</p>
        <p>It was made using a mix of javascript, html, and Perchance's unique programming language. I personally programmed every part of
          it, including user-suggested additions such as a function to shuffle the names around within the current joke (or, since the jokes are 
          all dialogue-based scenarios that purposely missattribute certain quotes to certain poeple, "incorrect quote") and a button that 
          automatically copies the current joke to the user's clipboard. Most of the jokes are user-suggested additions which I still add to this day.</p> 
        <p>I don't remember exactly when I published the Incorrect Quote Generator, nor is that record readily available, but I recall making it 
          some time in the summer of 2021. After its publishing, it rapidly gained far more regular users than I expected and is currently known 
          as the second most popular page on the site (seconded only by the welcome page). As of writing this (April 8th, 2023)  it has more than 
          2.5 million views.</p>
        <p>Below here is an embeded version of the Incorrect Quote Generator in case you're interested in using it. However, if you'd like to
          see the page itself, it is located <a href="https://perchance.org/incorrect-quote-generator">here.</a></p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center">The Vocal Qualities Generator</h3>
        <p>This is another perchance-hosted generator, though a far less popular one at that. It's used to generate randomized vocal traits
          in order to help the user come up with a unique voice for things such as games of Dungeons and Dragons or voice acting practice. As like
          all other programs on this page, all programming in this generator is made from scratch by me.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center">Perchance Censorship Tool</h3>
        <p>This is another program hosted on Perchance, though it isn't intended to function only as a randomized generator like this others. Since
         all code on Perchance is open source and therefore able to be copied by anybody, this tool is meant to be used by others so that they can 
         include a toggleable option for the user to censor swears in the generator's output. This is used on my Incorrect Quote Generator to allow
         that very option.</p>
        <p>The Perchance Censorship Tool is located <a href="https://null.perchance.org/censor-code-testing">here.</a></p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center">This Website!</h3>
        <p>This website is my first proper foray into html (the programming language which is used to make most websites). Though my perchance projects
          have allowed me to get a taste of it, this website has allowed me to dig deeper into the possible functions and methods of html
          programming by giving me a space to work with things such as tabs and embedded content.</p>
